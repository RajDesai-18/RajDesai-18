## Hey there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35">

I'm [Raj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajdesai18/), a software engineer based in Dallas.

I like building things around real problems. 

If something bugs me enough, I'll plan it, build it, and ship it.

My main tech stack is Python, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and FastAPI.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects below, check them out!

<!-- My favorite is [Project Name](link) — uncomment when you have one -->

**Fun Facts:**
- Coffee is non-negotiable ☕
- Solo Leveling is my favorite anime
- When I'm not coding, I'm on long drives with music on full blast 🎵
- I spend way too much time on YouTube watching videos about tech gadgets and cars
- **Hobbies:** curating playlists, discovering new artists, cars

**Currently:** MS CS @ UT Dallas · Graduating May 2026 · Open to full-time SWE, full-stack roles
